        <h1>YellowStone </h1>
    <dl>
        <dt>How do I get there?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Three of the five entrances to Yellowstone National Park are located in Montana’s Yellowstone Country; they can be accessed through West Yellowstone, Gardiner and Cooke City, MT</dd>
        <dt>Arriving by Air?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport (BZN) is the busiest airport in Montana, with 15 nonstop flights from major cities. From Bozeman, the West entrance in West Yellowstone, MT is a 90-mile drive and the North entrance in Gardiner, MT is a 78-mile drive.</dd>
        <dt>Is the park open year-round?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">The park is open all year, but not all of the roads are open to motorized vehicles during the winter, which makes it a magical time to visit. Snowcoach and snowmobile tours are offered, and the steaming hot pots and geysers are even more dramatic against the cold wintry landscape. Fewer people visit in the winter, which gives it a different feel—the quietness is uncanny.</dd>
        <dt>What animals can I expect to see?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Yellowstone is also home to nearly 300 species of birds, 16 species of fish, five species of amphibians and six species of reptiles.</dd>
        <dt>Can you stay in the park?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Yes, and we highly recommend it! Immersing yourself in the essence of the park gives a whole different perspective. Taking the time to experience the area over a few days is well worth it. There are nine lodging options in the summer, ranging from the most famous Old Faithful Inn to rustic cabins, or one of the newly renovated rooms in the elegant Lake Yellowstone Hotel.</dd>
        <dt>What can I do besides scenic driving?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Simply put, a lot. While scenic drives, photography and wildlife watching are the most popular activities in the park, exploration is endless. Adventurers can hike, fish, bike, horseback ride and boat. For those who prefer a more educational experience, sign up for a Ranger Program or seasonal talks. Yellowstone also offers a number of youth programs and activities.</dd>
        <dt>Can I get food, gas and supplies inside the park?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Gas, snacks and restaurants are all available within the park, but there is not a full-service grocery store. Gas pumps are available at Canyon, Fishing Bridge, Grant Village, Mammoth</dd>
        <dt>Does the park have cell service and internet connections?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Cell phone service is limited, but available at Old Faithful, Yellowstone Lake, Canyon, Grant and Mammoth Hot Springs Villages. Wireless internet can be purchased at select locations within these area lodges.</dd>
        <dt>Can I bring pets?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">YES</dd>
        <dt>What kind of clothes should I bring?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Boots are a good idea any time of year, especially if you plan to do some exploring off the beaten path.</dd>
